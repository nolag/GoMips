# gomips
A mips emulator written in Go

NOTE: This project is currently in pre-beta and may (likely will) have APIs change, contrary to how go projects are supposed to work.

For a sample of how to use the processor see (CS241 mips)[https://github.com/nolag/cs241mipssim].

Goals to come before non-breaking API promises are made:
Provide built in (MIPS 1)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture#MIPS_I] user mode simulator
